  <h1>How Generative AI Works</h1>

  <p>
    Generative AI doesn't "think" like a human; it is a world-class pattern-matching engine. At its core, it uses complex
    mathematical models to predict what should come next based on what it has seen before.
  </p>

  <h2>1. The “Autofill on Steroids” (Text)</h2>
  <p>
    Most text-based AI (like ChatGPT or Claude) uses an architecture called a <strong>Transformer</strong>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Tokenization:</strong> It breaks text into small chunks called tokens.</li>
    <li><strong>Attention Mechanism:</strong> Helps the model focus on the most relevant words to understand context.</li>
    <li><strong>Probability:</strong> It predicts the next token using statistical likelihood.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. The “Digital Sculptor” (Images)</h2>
  <p>
    Image generators (like Midjourney or DALL·E) often use a process called <strong>Diffusion</strong>.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Adding Noise:</strong> Random pixels are added to images during training.</li>
    <li><strong>Reverse Diffusion:</strong> The model learns to remove noise.</li>
    <li><strong>Creation:</strong> Starts from noise and sculpts an image based on learned patterns.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Training vs Inference</h2>
  <p>Understanding the lifecycle is key:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Training:</strong> Model learns from massive datasets (expensive + slow).</li>
    <li><strong>Inference:</strong> Real-time generation using learned patterns.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    <strong>Key Takeaway:</strong> GenAI is probabilistic, not deterministic. It generates outputs on the fly, which makes it
    creative—but sometimes wrong.
