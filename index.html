  <h1>Generative AI – Learning Artifact</h1>
  <p><strong>Author:</strong> Ram Gopal Kasireddy </p>
  <p>This page explains what Generative AI is, how it works, where it is used, and the risks and best practices involved.</p>

  <h2>1. What is Generative AI?</h2>
  <p>
    Generative AI (GenAI) refers to artificial intelligence systems that can create new content such as text, code, images,
    audio, and video. Unlike traditional AI that only classifies or predicts, GenAI produces original outputs based on patterns
    learned from large datasets.
  </p>

  <h2>2. How Does Generative AI Work?</h2>
  <p>
    Most GenAI systems are based on neural networks called <strong>transformers</strong>. These models are trained on massive
    datasets and learn to predict the next most likely word, pixel, or token in a sequence. Over time, the model learns language
    structure, logic patterns, and relationships.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Training on large datasets</li>
    <li>Learning patterns and probabilities</li>
    <li>Generating new outputs from prompts</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Popular GenAI Models & Tools</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>ChatGPT – Text and code generation</li>
    <li>DALL·E / Midjourney – Image generation</li>
    <li>GitHub Copilot – AI coding assistant</li>
    <li>Claude, Gemini – Large Language Models</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Real-World Use Cases</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Code generation and debugging</li>
    <li>Content creation and summarization</li>
    <li>Customer support chatbots</li>
    <li>Design, art, and marketing</li>
    <li>Education and tutoring</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Risks and Limitations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Hallucinations (confident but wrong answers)</li>
    <li>Bias in training data</li>
    <li>Data privacy and leakage</li>
    <li>Over-reliance on AI outputs</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Best Practices for Safe Use</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Never share confidential or personal data</li>
    <li>Verify important outputs</li>
    <li>Use AI as an assistant, not a replacement</li>
    <li>Follow organizational AI policies</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. My Learning Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    Through learning Generative AI, I realized that while these systems are powerful productivity tools, they also introduce
    new risks related to security, privacy, and trust. My goal is to understand not only how to use GenAI, but how to use it
    responsibly and strategically in engineering systems.
