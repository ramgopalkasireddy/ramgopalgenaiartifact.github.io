<h1>What is Generative AI?</h1>

<p>
Generative AI, sometimes called gen AI, is artificial intelligence (AI) that can create original content such as text, images, video, audio or software code in response to a user’s prompt or request.
Unlike traditional AI that analyzes existing data, generative AI uses deep learning models like transformers and GANs to generate novel, human-like outputs in response to user prompts. 


<p>Generative AI relies on sophisticated machine learning models called deep learning models algorithms that simulate the learning and decision-making processes of the human brain. These models work by identifying and encoding the patterns and relationships in huge amounts of data, and then using that information to understand users' natural language requests or questions and respond with relevant new content.
