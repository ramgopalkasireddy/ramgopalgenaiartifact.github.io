  <h1>What is Generative AI?</h1>

  <p>
    Generative AI (GenAI) is a type of artificial intelligence that can create original content such as text, images, video, audio, and software code in response to a user’s prompt or request.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unlike traditional AI systems that only analyze existing data, GenAI uses deep learning models—such as Transformers and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)—to generate new, human-like outputs based on patterns it learned from massive datasets.
  </p>

  <p>
    At its core, Generative AI relies on neural networks that simulate how the human brain learns. These models encode relationships in data and use that knowledge to understand natural language requests and produce meaningful, context-aware responses.
